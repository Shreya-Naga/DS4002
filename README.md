## Table of Contents
[SRC](#SRC)  - This section contains the scripts from our exploratory data analysis phase, and main the analysis phase. The EDA scripts can be used to replicate our initial graphs, while the analysis script can be run to display our main investivation.

[DATASET](#Dataset)  - This section contains the original "cdc_npao.csv" dataset obtained from Data World. It also contains "clean.csv", which is the cleaned up dataset to suit our project needs.

[FIGURES](#Figures)  - This section contains all figures from our exploratory data analysis phase and main analysis phase, as well as descriptions of their key takeaways.

[References](#References)  - This section contains all references that were used throughout the project, as well as links to the MI1 and MI2 Assignments.

## SRC

### Installing/Building Code
To install/build the code, VSCode and Python is required. Then, the scripts in the 'src', 'model', and 'data' folder are required to run the code. 

Required libraries:
- 

### Usage of Code
The code can be used to replicate our analysis or build upon it.

## FIGURES

### Figures Table
| Figure| Description |                   
|-------|------------|
| Figure 1 | The figure shows that the Southern region of the United States has the highest rate of the average percentage of adults who consume fruit less than one time daily, at about 45%. This means that on average, people who live in the South are less likely to consume fruit than adults in other regions. After the Southern region, the Unknown category is the second largest percentage, indicating that there is not enough information about where those people who were surveyed are from. After that, the Midwest has the third largest percentage at 40%, followed by West at about 37% and Northeast at about 35%. The Northeast region of the United States has the lowest average percentage of all regions, meaning that they, on average, consume more fruit than their counterparts in other regions of America. This can provide interesting information as to what kind of balanced diets people in these regions consume. |
| Figure 2 | The figure clearly shows that the south has the highest rate of obesity out of the five regions. When discussing this trend, we have hypothesized that this might be correlated with the fact that the most common and well-known cuisines of the south involve fried foods. Notably, fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and barbeque. Another observation we can make from this graph is that the lowest percentage of adult obesity is in the northeast region. Although there are many different factors that can be leading to this discrepancy between the regions, the other data in this data set may be indicators of why this is. Overall, the rate of obesity in all five regions lies between 25 and 33 percent which is rather high for the country overall. This can be attributed to many different things including the economy, traditions, societal standards, and more. |
| Figure 3 | The figure displays the count of college graduates by region based on the dataset. We chose to explore this factor because research has revealed a correlation between education and obesity. According to the CDC, obesity prevalence decreases as the level of education increases. Therefore, college graduates have a lower prevalence of obesity compared to those with high school degrees or lower [2]. However, from the bar chart, it is evident that the South region has the highest count of college graduates, and, according to Figure 2, the South also has the highest obesity rate. Although the South should display the lowest count of college graduates in accordance with the research, the results can be attributed to other factors. For instance, the four regions above do not have the same sample size, so there could be some imbalances due to that factor. The South is comparatively the largest region geographically and population-wise. Thus, the population could have influenced the count of college graduates in the dataset. |
